## Features
- Learn : At GrowWise, children can explore the Learn section, where they interact with fun, hands-on lessons about letters, numbers, shapes, fruits and veggies. Each activity uses colorful animations, sounds, videos and touch features which are age-appropriate and  help children learn through discovery and play rather than rote memorization. 

- Grow: After learning new concepts, they move to the Grow section, where they practice what theyâ€™ve learned with short quizzes. These activities help reinforce their knowledge in a playful way. They also earn coins for the correct answers in the quiz sections.

- Shop: As they complete lessons and quizzes, children earn points they can use in the Shop to customize their avatars with fun items. This reward system keeps them excited and motivated to continue learning.
